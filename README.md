# ðŸ“„ Plagiarism Detector using Machine Learning

This Python project uses machine learning and natural language processing to detect plagiarism between two text files.

## ðŸ”§ What it does:
- Reads two `.txt` files
- Vectorizes text using TF-IDF
- Calculates cosine similarity between the documents
- Reports similarity score and detection

## ðŸ›  Tools Used:
- Python
- Scikit-learn (TF-IDF + cosine similarity)

## ðŸš€ How to Run

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
